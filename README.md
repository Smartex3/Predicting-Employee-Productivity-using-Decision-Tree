# Predicting-Employee-Productivity-using-Decision-Tree
# Introduction
This project aims to predict employee productivity using machine learning techniques, specifically employing a Decision Tree algorithm. The decision tree is a powerful tool for classification tasks, and in this context, it helps identify patterns and factors that contribute to employee productivity.

# Overview
The project involves the following key steps:

- Dataset: Details about the dataset used for training and evaluation.
- Preprocessing: Steps taken to clean and prepare the data for training.
- Training: Training the Decision Tree model on the preprocessed data.
- Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using relevant metrics.
- Results: Summarizing the findings and results obtained from the model.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available in the data directory,it is available on the [UCI repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/597/productivity+prediction+of+garment+employees). It includes relevant features such as employee performance metrics, smv, work hours, and other factors that may influence productivity.

# Preprocessing
The preprocessing steps involve handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. These steps are crucial for ensuring the model receives clean and meaningful input.

# Training
The Decision Tree model is trained using the DecisionTreeClassifier from the scikit-learn library. The training script is available in the Decision Tree; Predicting Employee Productivity.ipynb file.

# Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify instances of employee productivity.

# Results
The results obtained from the trained Decision Tree model are summarized at the end of the jupyter notebook. This includes key findings, insights, and potential areas for improvement.
